# ofxRGBDepth Addon

** Addon for combining with high definition video and depth data. Companion add on to the [RGBDToolkit](https://github.com/obviousjim/RGBDToolkit/) **

The RGBDToolkit is an experiment in a possible future of film making, where photographic data captured in 3-dimensions will allow for deciding camera angles after the fact, combining the languages of photography and data visualization. This hybrid computer graphics and video would allow for a storytelling medium at once imaginary and photo real.  The RGBDToolkit is a software work flow for augmenting high definition video with 3D scans from a depth sensor, such as an Xbox Kinect, to create a hybrid video and computer graphics. First a recording application allows you to calibrate a high definition video camera to the depth sensor, allowing their data streams to be merged. Secondly a visualization application allows for viewing the combined footage and applying different 3D rendering styles, camera moves, and exporting sequences. 

This software is a science fiction, a seed of a potential future functional just to the point of allowing a community, you, to share in imagining the possibilities.

## Projects

## Background
RGBDToolkit is an ongoing labor of love by the main developers:

* [James George](http://www.jamesgeorge.org), developer 
* [Alexander Porter](http://www.alexanderporter.net), experimental photographer 
* [Jonathan Minard](http://www.deepspeedmedia.com), documentarian 
* [Mike Heavers](http://mikeheavers.com/), web & design
* Jack Armitage, documentation and tutorial videos

Development has been assisted by the expertise, guidance and advice of [Elliot Woods](http://www.kimchiandchips.com) and [Kyle McDonald](http://www.kylemcdonald.com)

## Inspiration
The Toolkit was inspired by many authors, futurists, and theorists who think creatively about the future of imaging, technology and culture:

 * [Towards a Philosophy of Photography](http://www.amazon.com/Towards-Philosophy-Photography-Vilem-Flusser/dp/1861890761) by [Vilem Flusser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vil%C3%A9m_Flusser)
 * [Shaping Things](http://www.amazon.com/Shaping-Things-Mediaworks-Pamphlets-Sterling/dp/0262693267) by [Bruce Sterling](http://www.wired.com/beyond_the_beyond/)
 * [Vision Machine](http://pdflibrary.files.wordpress.com/2008/05/paul-virilio-the-vision-machine.pdf) by [Paul Virilio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Virilio)

## Support for the Toolkit
The Toolkit has been made possible by the ongoing and generous support of:

* [The Frank-Ratchye STUDIO for Creative Inquiry](http://studioforcreativeinquiry.org/)
* [Eyebeam Art+Technology center](http://eyebeam.org)
* [YCAM InterLab](http://www.ycam.jp/en/interlab/)
* [NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program](http://itp.nyu.edu)
